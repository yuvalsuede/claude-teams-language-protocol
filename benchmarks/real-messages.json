Kept DIRECT_URL (used by Prisma schema for migrations, not in Zod config). All vars now match config/index.ts + prisma schema.\n4.

Placeholder UI FIXED: Comment button: removed entirely (hidden until feature ships) instead of half-visible disabled state. Share button: conditionally rendered — only shows when Web Share API is available (navigator.share), hidden on desktop browsers that lack it.

      "verbose": "Hello team lead, I wanted to give you a detailed progress update on task number 3. Here's what I've found and done so far:\n\nRegarding console.log statements: I checked all the frontend files and found that the only console.log statements in the frontend codebase are located in VideoFeed.tsx, which is the coder agent's domain, so I did not touch those. In the backend, there are zero console.log statements. There is one console.error in the config/index.ts file that's used for startup validation, which I kept intentionally since it's needed for debugging configuration issues. In the frontend libraries, there are some console.warn calls used for storage errors, which I also kept since they represent legitimate error handling.\n\nRegarding pipeline imports: Everything is clean. I searched the entire backend codebase and found no remaining imports of any of the deleted pipeline module files. I did notice that the word 'pipeline' appears in some feed/*.ts files, but those references are to Redis pipelines and internal method names, which are completely legitimate and unrelated to the deleted module.\n\nRegarding the .env.example file: I've fixed this by adding the missing Supabase environment variables - specifically SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, and SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY. These were all defined and used in the config/index.ts file but were missing from the .env.example documentation. I also kept the DIRECT_URL variable since it's used by the Prisma schema for database migrations, even though it's not part of the Zod configuration validation. All variables now properly match what's expected by config/index.ts and the Prisma schema.\n\nRegarding API type mismatches: I carefully reviewed the FeedVideo, Video, FeedCreator, and feed response types across both the frontend and backend. All of the frontend types in api-types.ts accurately mirror the shapes of the backend response objects. I found no mismatches.\n\nRegarding the placeholder UI elements: I've made two changes. First, the comment button has been removed entirely rather than being displayed in a half-visible disabled state - it will be hidden until the comment feature actually ships. Second, the share button is now conditionally rendered and only shows when the Web Share API is available via navigator.share. On desktop browsers that don't support the Web Share API, the button is now hidden instead of being non-functional. I also added proper event handling with stopPropagation and a catch handler on the share promise.\n\nThe files I changed are: backend/.env.example (added the missing Supabase environment variables) and web/src/components/feed/VideoSlide.tsx (removed the comment button and fixed the share button behavior).\n\nI'm now waiting for the QA agent to complete their audit so I can work on any additional bugs they find."

      "verbose": "Hello team lead, I've completed my comprehensive quality audit of the entire Peekaz codebase. Here is my full bug report, organized by severity level:\n\nCRITICAL SEVERITY ISSUES:\n\nFirst, I found a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in the content routes file. The admin video CRUD routes, specifically the POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints for /api/admin/videos as well as the POST endpoint for /api/admin/series, located at lines 140 through 166, only use the basic 'authenticate' middleware but do NOT include the 'adminOnly' middleware. This means that any authenticated user, whether they are a parent, child, or creator, can create, update, and delete videos and create series. The adminOnly middleware needs to be added to the preHandler chain for all of these routes.\n\nSecond, I found another critical issue in the engagement routes file. The like and unlike endpoints at lines 9 through 19 accept any profileId in the request body without verifying ownership. This means an authenticated user can like or unlike videos on behalf of any profile, not just their own children's profiles. The system should verify that the authenticated user actually owns the profileId being used.\n\nThird, there's a similar critical issue in the content routes file for the save, unsave, getSaved, and checkSaved endpoints at lines 86 through 111. They also accept any profileId without verifying ownership, which means any authenticated user can manipulate saves for any profile in the system.\n\nHIGH SEVERITY ISSUES:\n\nI found that the VideoFeed component references CSS classes called 'feed-strip' and 'feed-panel' at lines 584, 595, 609, and 627, but these classes are NOT defined anywhere in globals.css. This means these elements have no styling rules applied, so the three-panel strip layout is completely unstyled.\n\nThe VideoFeed component also contains 6 console.log statements at lines 260, 262, 267, 289, 293, and 385 that are left in production code. These fire on every swipe and navigation action.\n\nIn the config/index.ts file at line 26, the SIGNING_SECRET has an insecure default value set with .default('dev-signing-secret-change-me'). This means if the environment variable is not set, the application will run in production with a known, predictable secret.\n\nThe seed file contains hardcoded weak passwords: 'admin123' for the admin user at line 60 and 'creator123' for the creator at line 73.\n\nIn hash.ts at line 13, the hashPin function uses plain SHA-256 hashing without any salt. Since PINs are only 4-6 digits, this creates an extremely small keyspace that makes brute-force attacks trivial.\n\nMEDIUM SEVERITY ISSUES:\n\nThere's a conflict between the scroll-snap CSS in globals.css at lines 200-203 which sets scroll-snap-type: y mandatory on the feed-container, while VideoFeed.tsx uses a custom JavaScript drag and animation system with translateY transforms. These two approaches conflict with each other.\n\nThe VideoSlide component at line 33 declares an onTap prop in its TypeScript interface, but this prop is never actually used in the component or destructured from props at line 48. This is dead code.\n\nThe admin service file imports the redis module at line 2 but never uses it anywhere in the class.\n\nIn the feed monitoring module at line 315, the code uses redis.keys('session:*:shown') which has O(N) complexity and will block Redis when there are large datasets. It should use SCAN instead.\n\nThe content service's getSavedVideos function has a cursor calculation off-by-one error at line 265. It uses saves[saves.length - 2].id for the nextCursor, but this could skip items.\n\nIn feed.service.ts at line 295, the hasMore check uses pool.length > limit, but pool is the filtered candidate pool of up to 500 items, not the page results. This means hasMore will almost always be true if there are more than 10 videos in the database.\n\nThe API client at lines 85-89 handles 401 responses by calling handleTokenRefresh() and then retrying the same request. If the refresh succeeds but the new token also gets a 401, this will recurse infinitely. A retry counter is needed.\n\nIn config/index.ts at lines 7-8, SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY both have .default('') which means empty strings will silently pass validation but cause runtime errors when the Supabase client tries to use them.\n\nCROSS-CUTTING FINDINGS:\n\nI confirmed that there are no remaining imports of the deleted pipeline module files anywhere in the codebase. The API types in the frontend accurately match the backend response shapes. All feed API client endpoints match the actual backend routes."

      "verbose": "Great work on completing your original task items! Now I need you to move on to the bugs that the QA agent found during their audit. I've organized them by priority so you should work on the critical ones first.\n\nStarting with the critical security issues:\n\nFirst, in the content routes file at lines 140 through 166, you need to add the adminOnly middleware to the preHandler chain for all the admin video CRUD endpoints and the series creation endpoint. Right now they only have the basic authenticate middleware, which means any logged-in user can perform admin operations.\n\nSecond, in the engagement routes file at lines 9 through 19, you need to add a profile ownership verification check to the like and unlike endpoints. Currently, any authenticated user can like or unlike videos on behalf of any profile by passing any profileId in the request body.\n\nThird, also in the content routes file at lines 86 through 111, you need to add the same profile ownership verification to the save, unsave, getSaved, and checkSaved endpoints. They have the same vulnerability where any user can manipulate any profile's saved videos.\n\nFor the high priority items:\n\nIn config/index.ts at line 26, remove the insecure default value for the SIGNING_SECRET environment variable. It currently has .default('dev-signing-secret-change-me') which means production could run with a known secret if the env var is missing.\n\nAlso in config/index.ts at lines 7 and 8, remove the empty string defaults for SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY. These should be required environment variables, not optional with empty defaults.\n\nIn hash.ts at line 13, the PIN hashing function uses plain SHA-256 without a salt. You should migrate this to use bcrypt, or at minimum add a proper salt.\n\nFor the medium priority items:\n\nIn admin.service.ts at line 2, remove the unused redis import.\n\nIn feed.monitoring.ts at line 315, replace the redis.keys call with a SCAN loop to avoid O(N) blocking.\n\nIn content.service.ts at line 265, fix the cursor calculation off-by-one error in getSavedVideos.\n\nIn feed.service.ts at line 295, fix the hasMore heuristic so it correctly indicates whether there are more results.\n\nIn api-client.ts at lines 85-89, add a retry counter to prevent infinite 401 retry loops.\n\nImportant: do NOT touch the VideoFeed.tsx file, as the coder agent is currently working on rewriting that component."

      "verbose": "Hello team lead, I'm happy to report that I've completed all of the bugs identified by the QA agent. The TypeScript compiler reports no errors for both the frontend and backend.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of everything I fixed:\n\nFor the critical severity issues, I fixed all three:\n\nFirst, in the content routes file, I added the adminOnly middleware to the preHandler array for all four admin video and series CRUD endpoints, including the POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints for /api/admin/videos and the POST endpoint for /api/admin/series.\n\nSecond, in the engagement routes file, I added a verifyProfileOwnership middleware check to the like, unlike, and getLikes endpoints. This verifies that the authenticated user's JWT token corresponds to the owner of the profileId being used in the request.\n\nThird, also in the content routes file, I added the same verifyProfileOwnership middleware check to the save, unsave, getSaved, and checkSaved endpoints to prevent users from manipulating other profiles' saved videos.\n\nFor the high severity issues, I also fixed all three:\n\nIn the config file, I removed the insecure default value for SIGNING_SECRET. The environment variable is now required and the application will fail to start if it's not provided.\n\nAlso in the config file, I changed the SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY validations from .default('') to .min(1), which means they're now effectively required and cannot be empty strings.\n\nIn hash.ts, I migrated the PIN hashing from SHA-256 to bcrypt, making it an async operation. I also updated the two callsites that use these functions: auth.service.ts now awaits the hashPin call, and pin-gate.ts now awaits the verifyPin call.\n\nFor the medium severity issues, I fixed all five:\n\nI removed the unused redis import from admin.service.ts.\n\nI replaced the redis.keys('session:*:shown') call in feed.monitoring.ts with a proper SCAN loop that iterates through keys without blocking Redis.\n\nI fixed the cursor calculation in content.service.ts so it now correctly uses saves[limit-1].id instead of saves[saves.length-2].id.\n\nI fixed the hasMore heuristic in feed.service.ts to correctly check both that feedVideos.length is greater than or equal to the limit AND that the pool.length is greater than feedVideos.length.\n\nI added a _retryCount property to the API client to prevent infinite 401 retry loops, with a maximum of 1 retry attempt.\n\nIn total, I modified 11 files across the codebase."

      "verbose": "Hello team lead, I've completed the VideoFeed rewrite. Here's a summary of all the changes I made:\n\nIn VideoFeed.tsx, I did a complete rewrite of the scrolling mechanism. I removed all of the manual translateY animation code, including the animateTo function, the setTimeout-based transitions, the requestAnimationFrame calls, the noTransition flag, the dragOffset state, the isDragging state, the tapSignal system, the containerHeight calculation, the wheelCooldown throttling, and all of the touch, mouse, and pointer event handlers. Instead, the component now renders all videos as children of a scroll-snap container. I added an IntersectionObserver on the container that detects the currently visible video when the intersection ratio exceeds 0.5. Desktop keyboard and arrow button navigation now uses scrollIntoView with smooth behavior. All 6 console.log statements have been removed.\n\nIn VideoSlide.tsx, I removed the tapped state, the onTap prop, and the onEnded prop. I added a per-slide IntersectionObserver that tracks whether the slide is visible, stored in an isVisible state variable. Videos now automatically play when visible and pause when scrolled away. Tap-to-pause is now handled directly via a handleTap onClick handler on the slide wrapper div, which uses a slideRef.\n\nIn globals.css, I changed touch-action from none to manipulation on the html and body elements. I added touch-action: pan-y on the feed-container to enable native vertical scrolling. I also removed overflow: hidden from the desktop feed-container media query since it was blocking the scroll-snap behavior.\n\nTypeScript compiles cleanly with no errors."

      "verbose": "Hello team lead, I've completed the TikTok UI accuracy audit and polish. TypeScript compiles cleanly with no errors. Here's a detailed breakdown of all 10 areas I improved:\n\nFirst, the sidebar on desktop. I increased the width from 72 pixels to 76 pixels and added a subtle border-right separator line. I added a teal-colored active indicator bar on the left edge that scales in when a nav item is active. The logo is now a 'P' brand mark rendered in teal with a hover scale effect. The login button has been changed from teal to red to match TikTok's color scheme.\n\nSecond, the action buttons on mobile. I removed the background circles since TikTok uses bare icons with drop-shadow on mobile. I increased the icon size from 24 pixels to 28 pixels and added a drop-shadow filter for legibility. The count font was reduced from 12 pixels to 11 pixels with text-shadow added. When the like button is active, the count text is now also shown in red, not just the icon. The save button when active now shows in yellow (#FFD60A) instead of teal. I added back the comment button in a disabled state at 0.4 opacity for visual completeness. Desktop action buttons still retain their background circles to match TikTok's web layout. I also added a follow '+' button on the mobile avatar.\n\nThird, the video info overlay at the bottom left. The username is now 17 pixels bold with -0.01em letter-spacing and text-shadow for legibility. The description now shows both the title and description combined with a middot separator. The category emoji has been moved inline after the username at 0.7 opacity for subtlety. I added a spinning vinyl disc animation and a horizontally scrolling marquee text for the sound information row.\n\nFourth, the progress bar. I reduced the height from 3 pixels to 2 pixels to be thinner like TikTok. The color was changed from red to white at 85% opacity to match TikTok's web implementation. I also added a border-radius on the fill end.\n\nFifth, the bottom gradient overlay. I increased the height from 50% to 60% and implemented a more gradual 4-stop gradient. I also added a z-index of 2 for proper layering above the video content.\n\nSixth, animations. I added a spring bounce effect to the like burst animation with rotation from -15 to 5 degrees and a glow shadow. The heart beat animation now has 5 steps for a snappier feel. I added a continuous 3-second disc spin rotation that pauses when the video is paused. The sound text now has a horizontal scroll marquee animation.\n\nSeventh, the desktop layout. The video container width was increased from 400 pixels to 480 pixels to be closer to TikTok's web layout. Desktop actions and navigation arrows are now aligned to flex-end at the bottom. The navigation arrows were reduced from 48 pixels to 40 pixels with improved hover and active states. The avatar was changed from 52 pixels to 44 pixels on mobile and 48 pixels on desktop.\n\nEighth, typography improvements. The username font weight was increased from 600 to 700. Hashtag font weight was also increased to 700 with text-shadow added. Action count text is now smaller with shadow for better legibility.\n\nNinth, the volume control. The button size was reduced from 40x40 pixels to 32x32 pixels for a more subtle appearance. The icon inside was reduced from 20 pixels to 16 pixels.\n\nTenth, the play/pause overlay. The size was reduced from 80x80 pixels to 64x64 pixels. The background was changed from black at 40% opacity to black at 30% opacity, and the blur was reduced for a lighter feel."

      "verbose": "Hello coder, the QA agent has completed their audit and found several issues that fall within your domain since they're related to VideoFeed.tsx and VideoSlide.tsx which you're currently rewriting. Here are the relevant findings:\n\nThe first issue is high priority: the VideoFeed component references CSS classes called 'feed-strip' and 'feed-panel' at lines 584, 595, 609, and 627, but these classes are not defined anywhere in globals.css. Since you're rewriting the scroll mechanism, your new implementation should handle this - either by defining these classes or by removing the references if they're no longer needed.\n\nThe second issue is medium priority: there's a conflict between the scroll-snap CSS in globals.css at lines 200-203 which sets scroll-snap-type: y mandatory on the feed-container, while the current VideoFeed.tsx uses a custom JavaScript drag and animation system with translateY transforms. These two approaches conflict with each other. Your scroll-snap rewrite should clean this up.\n\nThe third issue is also medium priority: the VideoSlide component declares an onTap prop at line 33 in its TypeScript interface, but this prop is never actually used or destructured. If you're modifying VideoSlide as part of your rewrite, please remove this unused prop.\n\nThe fourth issue is low priority: the mock video data takes up 74 lines of code hardcoded at lines 13-86 in VideoFeed.tsx. Consider moving this to a separate file or cleaning it up, though this is not urgent.\n\nThe fifth issue is also low priority: there's an eslint-disable-next-line comment at line 493 that suppresses a react-hooks/exhaustive-deps warning. Try to fix the dependency array properly in your rewrite rather than suppressing the warning.\n\nOn a positive note, the QA agent confirmed that there are no remaining pipeline import issues anywhere in the codebase, and the API types between the frontend and backend are all aligned correctly."
