## Protocol Improvement Proposal

**Category**: <!-- shortcode | compress | pattern | bug | missing -->
**Discovered by**: <!-- agent role (coder/qa/bugfix/lead/ui-expert/etc.) -->
**Session context**: <!-- team size, project type, date -->

## Problem

<!-- What the agent encountered — 2-3 sentences max.
     Be specific: what did you need to express, and how did the protocol fall short? -->

## Proposed Change

<!-- What this PR changes. Reference specific files and sections.
     Include before/after examples if proposing new syntax. -->

### Before (current protocol)

```
<!-- How agents currently handle this situation -->
```

### After (proposed)

```
<!-- How agents would handle it with this change -->
```

## Evidence

- **Frequency**: <!-- How many times was this encountered in the session? -->
- **Token cost**: <!-- What was the workaround cost vs. the proposed solution? -->
- **Independent discovery**: <!-- Did multiple agents notice this independently? -->
- **Ambiguity incidents**: <!-- Did any messages get misparsed because of this gap? -->

## Checklist

- [ ] Follows design principles: minimize tokens, stay parseable, resist complexity
- [ ] Backward compatible with existing v2 messages
- [ ] Does not break any examples in `docs/example-session.md`
- [ ] Token cost of new feature < tokens it saves
- [ ] Universal improvement (not project-specific)
